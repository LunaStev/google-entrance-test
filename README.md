# Google Entrance Test

A repository started out of curiosity about Google's hiring tests. I began this to study core concepts and improve my pure skills.

## Vocabulary of Custom Code Styles

In this repository, files are named using the format:

**problem_title_codestyle.extension**

Examples:
- `longest_common_prefix_visualestudiocodealgoritmo.py`

Naming breakdown:
- `problem_title`: the name of the algorithm problem (typically from Leetcode)
- `code_style`: a custom compound word that describes the learning approach or structure of the code
- `extension`: programming language used (e.g. `.rs`, `.c`, `.py`, etc.)

These custom style terms are invented to reflect how the code is written â€” for visualization, experimentation, simplicity, and more.

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Visualestudiocodealgoritmo | A compound of "Visual" + "Estudio" (Spanish for "study") + "Code" + "Algoritmo" (Spanish for "algorithm"). Refers to code written for visually structured learning and understanding of algorithmic problems. |
| (More to come) | (New terms will be added here as they are created.) |
